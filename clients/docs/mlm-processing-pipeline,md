# Steps

## load raw text with metadata

## transform to a json format compressed as zlib 

## a ("raw dataset") json.zlib reader 


## the train test split is on the ML pipeline, Ideally I should move it as an early step in the processing step
## trying to recover the pipeline I executed
### who generates the tokenized_batch ?
#### apparently I sent_tokenize in the selva-agreements repo
